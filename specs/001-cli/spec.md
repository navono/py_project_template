**Feature Branch**: `001-cli`

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to interact with a command-line interface that supports hierarchical commands, so that I can organize complex functionality into logical groups with main commands and subcommands.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the CLI tool is installed, **When** I run `tool --help`, **Then** I should see available top-level commands and usage instructions
2. **Given** I want to use a specific feature group, **When** I run `tool <command> --help`, **Then** I should see available subcommands for that command group
3. **Given** I want to execute a specific action, **When** I run `tool <command> <subcommand> [options]`, **Then** the tool should execute the corresponding functionality
4. **Given** I provide invalid arguments, **When** I run any command, **Then** the tool should display clear error messages and usage guidance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user provides a non-existent top-level command?
- How does the system handle missing required arguments for subcommands?
- What happens when a user provides conflicting options?
- How does the tool handle help requests for non-existent commands?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support multiple top-level commands as entry points
- **FR-002**: System MUST support subcommands under each top-level command  
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide help documentation for both top-level commands and subcommands
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate command syntax and provide appropriate error messages
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle command parsing and route to appropriate functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST support command-line arguments and options for both levels of commands
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear usage instructions when commands are used incorrectly

### Key Entities
- **Command**: A top-level action group that contains related subcommands
- **Subcommand**: A specific action within a command group
- **Option**: Configuration parameters that modify command behavior
- **Argument**: Required or optional inputs to commands and subcommands
